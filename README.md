# SAKHI-AI
'Sakhi' stands as a revolutionary chatbot dedicated to breaking the taboos 
surrounding women's health discussions. In societies where such conversations are 
often met with discomfort or shame, Sakhi provides a confidential platform for 
women to seek information without fear of judgment. Powered by artificial 
intelligence and natural language processing, Sakhi offers personalized responses to 
inquiries spanning reproductive health, menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and general 
wellness. Its emphasis on anonymity ensures inclusivity, catering to women from 
diverse backgrounds and demographics. 
Sakhi represents more than just a source of information; it symbolizes empowerment 
through knowledge and understanding. By fostering open dialogue and removing 
barriers to healthcare access, Sakhi empowers women to take control of their health 
decisions with confidence. This project report aims to delve into the development 
journey of Sakhi, highlighting its innovative technology and user-centric approach. 
Through Sakhi's existence, we envision a world where women can freely seek the 
support and guidance they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives, unencumbered by 
societal stigma.
